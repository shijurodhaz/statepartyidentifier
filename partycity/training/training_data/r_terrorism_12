thank
you
governor
kasich
Mr
trump
I
want
to
ask
you
about
someth
els
you
have
said
dure
the
cours
of
thi
campaign
you
said
that
the
US
ha
to
quot
"take
out"
the
famili
of
terrorist
when
it
wa
point
out
that
target
civilian
is
against
the
geneva
convent
you
said
quot
"so
they
can
kill
us
but
we
can not
kill
them?"
It
is
against
feder
militari
and
intern
law
to
target
civilian
So
how
will
you
order
the
militari
to
target
the
famili
of
suspect
terrorist
while
also
abid
by
the
law?
No
of
cours
not
We
have
never
target
innoc
civilian
and
we
are
not
go
to
start
now
but
listen
jake
I
understand
peopl
are
scare
and
for
seven
year
we
have
face
terrorist
attack
and
presid
obama
lectur
american
on
islamophobia
that
is
madden
but
the
answer
is
not
simpli
to
yell
"china
bad
muslim
bad"
you
have
got
to
understand
the
natur
of
the
threat
we
are
face
and
how
you
deal
with
them
and
ye
it
is
true
there
are
million
of
radic
islam
terrorist
who
seek
to
kill
us
We
need
a
presid
command
in
chief
focus
on
fight
them
and
I
will
tell
you
frankli
one
concern
I
have
with
donald
is
that
although
hi
languag
is
quit
incendiari
when
you
look
at
hi
substant
polici
on
iran
he
ha
said
he
would
not
rip
up
thi
iranian
nuclear
deal
I
think
that
a
mistak
the
ayatollah
khomeini
want
nuclear
weapon
to
murder
us
I
will
give
you
anoth
exampl
deal
with
islam
radic
terror
On
israel
donald
ha
said
he
want
to
be
neutral
between
israel
and
the
palestinian
As
presid
I
will
not
be
neutral
and
let
me
say
thi
week
a
texan
taylor
forc
He
wa
an
eagl
scout
he
wa
a
west
point
graduat
he
wa
an
armi
veteran
He
wa
murder
by
a
palestinian
terrorist
thi
week
in
israel
and
I
do
not
think
we
need
a
command
in
chief[bel
rings]who
is
neutral
between
the
palestinian
terrorist
and
one
of
our
strongest
alli
in
the
world
the
nation
of
israel

the
quot
that

donald
along
with
hillari
clinton
and
barack

say
they
want
to
treat
