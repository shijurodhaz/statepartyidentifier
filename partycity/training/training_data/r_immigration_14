If
someon
had
tri
to
describ
today
america
to
you
30
year
ago
you
would
have
listen
in
disbelief
american
know
that
our
nation
is
head
off
the
abyss
of
destruct
secondari
to
divis
fiscal
irrespons
and
failur
to
lead
marco
donald
ted
john
we
will
not
solv
ani
of
these
problem
by
tri
to
destroy
each
other
what
we
need
to
do
is
be
look
for
solut
tonight
it
not
about
us
it
about
the
american
peopl
[applause]

blitzer:
senat
cruz
you
say
you
want
to
deport
the
11
million
undocu
immigr
but
you
never
want
to
allow
them
to
come
back
to
the
unit
state
what
would
happen
to
the
children
who
are
us-
born
citizen
whose
parent
will
be
deport
under
your
plan?
I
believ
in
liberti
and
justic
for
all
I
think
everyth
that
we
do
should
be
fair
and
I
have
alreadi
describ
—
you
know
how
we
can
secur
the
border
We
need
to
secur
all
the
border
becaus
it
not
just
peopl
come
in
from
south
america
and
mexico
but
there
are
terrorist
who
want
to
destroy
us
who
are
get
across
our
border
fairli
easili
and
we
have
to
stop
that
but
in
term
of
the
peopl
who
are
here
alreadi
after
we
—
after
we
stop
the
illeg
immigr
we
need
to
be
reason
and
I
would
give
them
a
six-month
period
in
which
to
get
regist
as
a
guest
worker
assum
that
they
have
an
accept
record
they
have
to
pay
a
back-tax
penalti
have
to
pay
tax
go
forward
but
they
do
not
have
to
live
underground
anymor
and
I
think
they
do
not
becom
american
citizen
they
do
not
vote
If
they
want
to
becom
an
american
citizen
they
go
through
exactli
the
same
process
that
anybodi
els
goe
through
I
think
that
the
kind
of
situat
that
is
actual
fair
to
peopl
and
we
have
other
way
of
—
of
util
our
facil
and
our
talent
as
foreign
aid:
do
thing
in
south
america
and
central
america
and
mexico
that
improv
the
economi
there
so
that
they
do
not
feel
the
need
to
come
over
here
that
would
cost
us
a
lot
less
than
borrow
money
from
china
pay
interest
on
it
blitzer:
thank
you

Mr

campaign
as

If

the
way

we
will

we
will
elimin

the

the
