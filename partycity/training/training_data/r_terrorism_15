carolina
for
hi
brother
As
you
have
said
tonight
and
you
have
often
said
the
iraq
war
and
your
opposit
to
it
wa
a
sign
of
your
good
judgment
In
2008
in
an
interview
with
wolf
blitzer
talk
about
presid
georg
W
bush
conduct
of
the
war
you
said
you
were
surpris
that
democrat
leader
nanci
pelosi
did
not
tri
to
impeach
him
you
said
quote:
"which
person
I
think
would
have
been
a
wonder
thing"
when
you
were
ask
what
you
meant
by
that
and
you
said:
"for
the
war
for
the
war
he
lie
he
got
us
into
the
war
with
lies"
Do
you
still
believ
presid
bush
should
have
been
impeached?
